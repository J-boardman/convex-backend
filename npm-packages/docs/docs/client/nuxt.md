The [`@crbroughton/nuxt-convex` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crbroughton/nuxt-convex)
is community-maintained. Thank you to the maintainer
[Chris Visser](https://github.com/chris-visser) for his work on this project!

You're welcome to ask questions about the library on the
[Convex Discord](https://convex.dev/community) but opening a
[convex-nuxt GitHub](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-nuxt)
issue is a better way to request a new feature or report a bug.
